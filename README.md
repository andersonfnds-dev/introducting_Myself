- 👋 Hi, I’m a fullstack developer Jr.
- 👀 I’m interested in tecnology since I was a kid, and now I´m having the oportunity to study programming in a university, Centro Universitário de Brasília.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be a Java back-end developer. Beside the university, I´m studying from the plataform Udemy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Java projects to improve my skills with the language, so then I can get a job at my city, Brasília, or a remote one.  
- 📫 How to reach me: you can send me an email at @anderson.fndss@gmail.com / you can also text me at my Linkedin profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/anderson-fernandes-dev/
